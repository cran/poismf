topN.new(
  model,
  X,
  n = 10,

}
\arguments{
\item{model}{A Poisson factorization model as returned by `poismf`.}

\item{X}{Data with the non-zero item indices and counts for this new user. Can be
passed as a sparse vector from package `Matrix` (`Matrix::dsparseVector`, which can
be created from indices and values through `Matrix::sparseVector`), or as a `data.frame`,
in which case will take the first column as the item/column indices
(numeration starting at 1) and the second column
as the counts. If `X` passed to `poismf` was a `data.frame`, `X` here must also be
a `data.frame`.}

\item{n}{Number of top-N highest-predicted results to output.}

\item{include}{List of items which will be ranked. If passing this, will only
make a ranking among these items. If `X` passed to `poismf` was a
`data.frame`, must match with the entries in its second column,
otherwise should match with the columns of `X` (numeration starting at 1). Can only pass
one of `include` or `exclude.` Must not contain duplicated entries.}

\item{exclude}{List of items to exclude from the ranking. If passing this, will
rank all the items except for these. If `X` passed to `poismf` was a
`data.frame`, must match with the entries in its second column,
otherwise should match with the columns of `X` (numeration starting at 1). Can only pass
one of `include` or `exclude`. Must not contain duplicated entries.}

\item{output_score}{Whether to output the scores in addition to the IDs. If passing
`FALSE`, will return a single array with the item IDs, otherwise
will return a tuple with the item IDs and the scores.}

\item{l2_reg}{Strength of L2 regularization to use for optimizing the new factors. Note
that these are obtained through a conjugate-gradient method instead of
proximal gradient, which works better with smaller regularization values.}

\item{l1_reg}{Strength of the L1 regularization (see description of argument above).
Not recommended.}

\item{nupd}{Maximum number of conjugate gradient updates.}
}
\value{
\itemize{
  \item If passing `output_score=FALSE` (the default), will return a vector of size `n`
  with the top-N highest predicted items for this user.If the `X` data passed to
  `poismf` was a `data.frame`, will contain the item IDs from its second column,
  otherwise will be integers matching to the columns of `X` (starting at 1). If
  `X` was passed as `data.frame`, the entries in this vector might be coerced to
  character regardless of their original type.
  \item If passing `output_score=TRUE`, will return a list, with the first entry
  being the vector described above under name `ix`, and the second entry being the
  associated scores, as a numeric vector of size `n`.

Rank top-N highest-predicted items for a new user
}
\details{
This function calculates the latent factors in the same way as
`factors.single` - see the documentation of \link{factors.single}
for details.

The factors are initialized to the mean of each column in the fitted model.
