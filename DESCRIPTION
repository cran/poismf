Description: Creates a non-negative low-rank approximate factorization of a sparse counts matrix by maximizing Poisson
    likelihood with L1/L2 regularization (e.g. for implicit-feedback recommender systems or bag-of-words-based topic modeling)
    (Cortes, (2018) <arXiv:1811.01908>), which usually leads to very sparse user and item factors (over 90% zero-valued).
    Similar to hierarchical Poisson factorization (HPF), but follows an optimization-based approach with regularization
    instead of a hierarchical prior, and is fit through gradient-based methods instead of variational inference.
