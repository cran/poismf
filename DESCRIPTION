Description: Creates a low-rank factorization of a sparse counts matrix by maximizing Poisson likelihood with l1/l2 regularization
	with all non-negative latent factors (e.g. for recommender systems or topic modeling) (Cortes, (2018) <arXiv:1811.01908>).
	Similar to hierarchical Poisson factorization, but follows an optimization-based approach with regularization instead of a
	hierarchical structure, and is fit through gradient-based methods instead of variational inference.
